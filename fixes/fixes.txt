To get SDL2, SDL2-Image & SDL2-TTF working:
	0. Install chocolatey package manager for windows
	1. Install Cmder using Chocolatey: https://chocolatey.org/packages/Cmder
		choco install cmder
	2. Install mingw with chocolatey
		choco install mingw
	3. Download and copy all the SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf DLL's to SBCL's .exe folder, or for portacle, portacle/win/lib/:
		a. https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
		b. https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
		c. https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
		make sure to grab the x86 devel versions from all the release pages of the git repos.
	4. Extract libffi6.dll into your SBCL's .exe or lib folder, too. The dll should be in the fixes folder, or /fixes/sdl2/libffi_3.2.1_prebuilt_mingw_4.9.0_64bit.zip
	5. Download and copy the precompiled libffi folders include and .libs to the mingw64:
		https://proj.goldencode.com/projects/p2j/wiki/Building_and_Installing_libffi_on_Windows
    6. Copy the include and .libs folder to your chocolatey mingw folder:
		C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\mingw\tools\install\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\<libs/include>
		
All the necessary files should be in the fixes/sdl2/ folder, in case these links are dead.
