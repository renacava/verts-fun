Description:
	running verts-fun/projects/verts-fun/verts-fun.exe reports an error that it couldnt' find the libSOIL.dll, which it looks for in user/quicklisp/etc.
	we need to package dll's with the game, and make sure it checks for dll's in the packaged folder.
	or, better, we could just compile the game so it doesn't need dll's.
	but it does, since we're developing with it. fug.
	okay so it does need dll's.

Description:
	SDL2 receives an event whose enum > the last possible event.

Fix:
	Not sure. I tried the below:
		in skitter quicklisp folder/sdl2/sdl2.lisp:
		add this when statement to #'on-event
		(defun on-event (event &optional tpref)
			(when (<= 17 event)
				(return-from on-event))
			(%case-event (event)
				(:quit
				(:timestamp ts)
				(set-window-manager-qui......
	Though the sdl2 event isn't of type REAL. so i removed it, and now it works without issue. odd.
	
Status: 
	FIXED?
